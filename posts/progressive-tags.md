## Problem:

Even relatively simple hierarchical tagging systems can get tricky for users to interact with. What sub-category belongs to which category again?

Cascading drop downs across multiple columns could require rebuilding the options many times with many network requests and vectors of potential issues.

## Solution:

- render all tags 1x (there aren't _that_ many options in this use case)
- enforce hierarchy on client via disabling non-children
