## Problem:

Reading what's inside of stashed in device-specific localStorage isn't super fun and is near impossible to do for non-developers.

## Solution:

- loop through localStorage and print it out to screen
- allow simple UI to clear objects
- track changes in simple state to ensure a simply re-render on each change (no event listening)
